Marcus is on the 1 train heading to SVA W 21st Street studios for his Design Studio Hours block. He just boarded at West 4th Street; the ride will take approximately 12 minutes. His thesis critique milestone is coming up on October 14th.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Mode: **Navigation Mode**\\\\n\\\\n**Activation reasoning:**\\\\n- Calendar event: Design Studio Hours at SVA \\(9:00-17:00\\) — confidence boost\\\\n- GPS: Movement pattern indicates subway transit\\\\n- Location delta: Currently 1.2 miles from SVA studios\\\\n- Time context: 21 minutes until arrival \\(12 min ride + 9 min walk from station\\)\\\\n\\\\n**Confidence score:** 0.87 \\(hard activation threshold met\\)\\\\n\\\\nLifeOS entered Navigation Mode automatically. Marcus sees no confirmation prompt—the context was unambiguous.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Attention Layer State\\\\n\\\\n| Layer | Content |\\\\n|-------|---------||\\\\n| **Center** | Route status, ETA, 5 contextual intents |\\\\n| **Periphery** | 3 held messages \\(indicated as count only\\), Spotify controls |\\\\n| **Silence** | Reddit notifications, YouTube recommendations, news alerts, promotional emails |\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## The 5 Intents Marcus Sees\\\\n\\\\nLifeOS surfaces intents tailored to: Navigation Mode + 21-minute window + upcoming thesis milestone + Marcus behavioral patterns.\\\\n\\\\n### 1. **Review Thesis Outline**\\\\n> *You have 21 minutes. Your critique outline has 3 sections marked needs refinement.*\\\\n\\\\n- **Why surfaced:** Thesis milestone approaching \\(high stress\\), morning peak cognitive window, Marcus preparation patterns show he refines in transit\\\\n- **Bounded scope:** Opens outline in read/annotate mode only — no deep editing on mobile\\\\n- **Completion condition:** Reach destination OR mark sections as reviewed\\\\n- **Mode constraint:** Available in Navigation + Work modes\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n### 2. **Quick Reply to Sarah**\\\\n> *Sarah sent a message 23 minutes ago about critique prep. Tap to see preview.*\\\\n\\\\n- **Why surfaced:** Sarah Chen is high-priority during thesis work, message relates to shared thesis context, response latency expectation is high\\\\n- **Bounded scope:** Shows message preview, quick reply options, or Reply later defer\\\\n- **Completion condition:** Reply sent OR explicitly deferred\\\\n- **Mode constraint:** Available in Navigation mode for inner-circle contacts\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n### 3. **Preview Today Studio Plan**\\\\n> *Design Studio Hours start in 21 min. See your task queue for today?*\\\\n\\\\n- **Why surfaced:** Approaching calendar block, Marcus prefers mental preparation before arriving at work location\\\\n- **Bounded scope:** Read-only view of prioritized tasks for today studio session\\\\n- **Completion condition:** Dismissed OR arrival at destination\\\\n- **Mode constraint:** Navigation mode only \\(transitions to Work mode tasks on arrival\\)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n### 4. **Listen to Saved Podcast**\\\\n> *Design Ethics in the Age of AI — 18 min remaining. Resume?*\\\\n\\\\n- **Why surfaced:** Matches available time window \\(18 min ≈ 21 min transit\\), thesis-adjacent content, Marcus pattern of audio consumption during commute\\\\n- **Bounded scope:** Audio playback with pause/bookmark controls\\\\n- **Completion condition:** Episode ends, arrival, or explicit stop\\\\n- **Mode constraint:** Available in Navigation + Rest modes\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n### 5. **Do Nothing**\\\\n> *21 minutes of unscheduled time. Protect it?*\\\\n\\\\n- **Why surfaced:** LifeOS knows Marcus context-switching tolerance is low and his thesis stress is high. Sometimes the most valuable intent is intentional rest.\\\\n- **Bounded scope:** Silences all non-emergency content for remainder of transit. Shows only ETA.\\\\n- **Completion condition:** Arrival at destination\\\\n- **Mode constraint:** Available in all modes\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## What Marcus Does Not See\\\\n\\\\n**Held in Silence:**\\\\n- 2 Reddit notifications \\(r/InteractionDesign, r/UXDesign\\)\\\\n- 1 promotional email from design tool company\\\\n- YouTube video recommendation based on last night viewing\\\\n- News alert about NYC transit delays \\(not affecting his route\\)\\\\n\\\\n**Held in Periphery \\(count only\\):**\\\\n- 1 message from design cohort group chat \\(logistics\\)\\\\n- 1 email from contract client \\(non-urgent follow-up\\)\\\\n- 1 message from Mom \\(Good luck with your work today! — sent at 8:47 AM\\)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Constitutional Reasoning\\\\n\\\\nLifeOS intent selection reflects Marcus articulated values:\\\\n\\\\n| Value | Application |\\\\n|-------|-------------|\\\\n| *Protect flow state and cognitive momentum* | Surfaced thesis review \\(low-friction preparation\\) and Do Nothing option |\\\\n| *Sarah and Emma can always reach me during thesis crunch* | Sarah message surfaced as actionable intent |\\\\n| *I want to use transit time productively but not frantically* | Podcast option provides productive-feeling rest; no high-effort work intents |\\\\n| *Do not let small things accumulate into anxiety* | Quick reply intent prevents communication debt with close peer |\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## UI State \\(Watch + Phone\\)\\\\n\\\\n**Neural Smartwatch \\(Periphery indication\\):**\\\\n- Subtle haptic pulse when boarding confirmed Navigation Mode\\\\n- Display shows: SVA → 21 min + small badge 3 \\(held messages\\)\\\\n- No content previews on wrist\\\\n\\\\n**Phone \\(Center display if accessed\\):**\\\\n\\\\nNavigation Mode\\\\nSVA Design Studios\\\\nArriving ~9:35 AM • 21 min\\\\n\\\\n[📝 Review Thesis Outline - 3 sections to refine]\\\\n[💬 Quick Reply to Sarah - About critique prep]\\\\n[📋 Preview Studio Plan - Today task queue]\\\\n[🎧 Resume Podcast - 18 min remaining]\\\\n[🔇 Do Nothing - Protect this time]\\\\n\\\\nPeriphery \\(3\\) - Pull to view held messages''\n    }\n  ],\n  source: ''claude-code''\n}\\);\n\nconst options = {\n  hostname: ''localhost'',\n  port: 3001,\n  path: ''/api/conversations/import'',\n  method: ''POST'',\n  headers: {\n    ''Content-Type'': ''application/json'',\n    ''Content-Length'': Buffer.byteLength\\(data\\)\n  }\n};\n\nconst req = http.request\\(options, \\(res\\) => {\n  let body = '''';\n  res.on\\(''data'', \\(chunk\\) => body += chunk\\);\n  res.on\\(''end'', \\(\\) => console.log\\(body\\)\\);\n}\\);\n\nreq.on\\(''error'', \\(e\\) => console.error\\(''Error:'', e.message\\)\\);\nreq.write\\(data\\);\nreq.end\\(\\);\n\")",
