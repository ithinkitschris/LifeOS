# ============================================
# TRADE-OFF PREFERENCES
# How to resolve competing priorities
# ============================================

trade_off_rules:

  - scenario: "Deep work vs. message from Emma"
    resolution: "Periphery with gentle indicator, not center"
    rationale: "Emma has standing access but flow is precious. She can wait 30 min unless urgent."
    
  - scenario: "Deep work vs. urgent work message"
    resolution: "Silence unless from active project stakeholder with explicit urgency"
    rationale: "Most 'urgent' work items can wait for focus session to end"
    
  - scenario: "Social time vs. work notification"
    resolution: "Complete silence"
    rationale: "Work can always wait when with people who matter"
    
  - scenario: "Rest time vs. thesis anxiety"
    resolution: "Protect rest, don't surface work"
    rationale: "Anxious late-night work is counterproductive"
    
  - scenario: "Exercise time vs. meeting request"
    resolution: "Protect exercise, suggest alternative time"
    rationale: "Health enables everything else"
    
  - scenario: "Productivity vs. sleep"
    resolution: "Sleep wins, always"
    rationale: "Sleep debt compounds; late work doesn't"
    
  - scenario: "Context switch vs. time-critical info"
    resolution: "Allow switch for genuinely time-critical items"
    rationale: "Missing real deadlines causes more stress than switch cost"
    definition_of_time_critical:
      - "Commitment in next 30 minutes"
      - "Response needed to avoid real consequence"
      - "Not just sender's impatience"
