    example:
      value: "I want to be present with people when I'm with them"
      derived_rules:
        - "Social context detected → increase notification hold threshold"
        - "Co-located contacts detected → reduce periphery visibility"
        - "Social mode available when social signals strong"
        - "Work content during social time → Silence unless emergency"

    example_conflict:
      value_a: "I don't want to miss actually important things"
      value_b: "Work shouldn't bleed into everything"
      scenario: "Important work message arrives during family dinner"

    likely_approach: |
      Surface conflict to user with options rather than system deciding
      autonomously. The user resolves the tension, and that resolution
      informs future similar situations.
