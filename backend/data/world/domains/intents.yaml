# Core Concept: Intent's Role in the Framework
framework_position:
  description: |
    In the Domain → Mode → Intent → UI flow, Intents are the third stage:
    1. Life Domain - Informs the context category
    2. Mode - Determines the user's stance and filters available actions
    3. Intent - User-selected action from mode-appropriate options
    4. UI - Dynamically generated interface for the selected intent

  key_invariants:
    - "Intents are ALWAYS user-selected (never auto-executed)"
    - "Available intents are constrained by the current mode"
    - "Each intent has bounded scope with designed completion"
    - "Intents generate purpose-built UI, not generic app interfaces"

    rationale: |
      Bounded experiences, not infinite feeds. Every intent has designed
      completion, not endless engagement.

        lifeos_intent: "User selects intent based on goal"

      - aspect: "Availability"
        traditional_app: "Persistent, always available"
        lifeos_intent: "Available based on context (mode)"

      - aspect: "Alignment"

    mechanics:
      filtering: |
        The current mode acts as a filter over the universe of possible intents.
        Only intents relevant to the mode's purpose are surfaced to the user.

      surfacing: |
        When a mode is active, it determines which intents appear prominent (Center),
        which are available but de-emphasized (Periphery), and which are hidden (Silence).

      generation: |
        Once a user selects an intent, the orchestrator generates a purpose-built
        interface that serves that specific intent—not a generic app UI.
