# Mode–Intent Framework: Modes
# How modes work, their relationship to domains, and their fluid nature

# Core Concept: Domain → Mode → Intent Flow
framework_flow:
  description: |
    The Mode–Intent Framework follows a four-stage flow:
    1. Life Domain - The 7 fundamental categories of human activity
    2. Mode - A fluid, contextual stance activated within a domain
    3. Intent - Available actions surfaced by the active mode
    4. UI - Dynamically generated interface for the selected intent

  key_principle: |
    Modes are NOT fixed. Mode names emerge naturally from the intersection of 
    a Life Domain and the user's current situation. Each domain can spawn 
    countless contextual modes based on what the user is doing.

# Mode Fluidity Concept

  status: locked
  description: |
    Unlike traditional app categories, modes are fluid and emerge from context.
    A mode name like "Thesis Discussion" or "Quick Check-in" emerges naturally 
    from the intersection of domain and situation.

    description: "How modes are entered based on confidence signals"

    mechanics:
      confidence_based_entry: |
        Multiple context signals contribute to confidence score.
        Each signal has weight based on reliability and relevance.
        Confidence must exceed threshold for activation.

      thresholds:
        - type: "Soft activation"
          value: "~0.60"
          behavior: "System suggests mode: 'Looks like you're entering Focus. Confirm?'"

        - type: "Hard activation"
          value: "~0.85"
          behavior: "System enters mode automatically, explanation available"

        - type: "Exit threshold"
          value: "~0.40"
          behavior: "Hysteresis - must drop below this to exit"

      hysteresis_rationale: |
        Different thresholds for entry vs. exit prevents oscillation.
        Once in a mode, stay until clearly no longer appropriate.
