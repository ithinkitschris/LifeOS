principles:
  - id: modes-constrain-intents-execute
    number: 1
    name: "Modes Constrain, Intents Execute"
    status: locked
    summary: "Modes define stance and solution space. Intents are user-chosen actions within that space."
    details: |
      Never conflate these. The orchestrator determines modes based on
      environmental signals. Users choose intents within those modes.
      This separation is fundamental to agency preservation.
    implications:
      - "Mode UI should indicate stance, not offer choices"
      - "Intent UI should present bounded options within current mode"
      - "Mode transitions require explanation, intent selection does not"

  - id: center-periphery-silence
    number: 2
    name: "Center-Periphery-Silence (Not Binary)"
    status: locked
    summary: "Information exists on an attention spectrum. Reject show/hide binary thinking."
    details: |
      Traditional interfaces either show information (demanding attention)
      or hide it completely. The three-layer model allows information to
      exist at appropriate attention levels.
    implications:
      - "Design for three states, not two"
      - "Periphery requires subtle but discoverable indicators"
      - "Silence must be retrievable on demand"

  - id: reversible-explainable-auditable
    number: 3
    name: "Automation Must Be Reversible, Explainable, and Auditable"
    status: locked
    summary: "Every automated decision can be undone, understood, and reviewed."
    details: |
      Trust in automation requires the ability to reverse mistakes,
      understand reasoning, and review past decisions.
    implications:
      - "Instant undo for mode changes"
      - "Plain-language explanations for all decisions"
      - "Dashboard provides retrospective audit trail"

  - id: freedom-through-tradeoffs
    number: 4
    name: "Freedom Preserved Through Explicit Trade-offs"
    status: locked
    summary: "Context switching always possible. Friction makes costs visible."
    details: |
      Freedom doesn't mean frictionless. Freedom means informed choice.
      The system surfaces what you gain and lose with each decision.
    implications:
      - "Exit always available"
      - "Friction is informational, not obstructive"
      - "Trade-offs stated clearly: 'This is what you're leaving'"

  - id: no-punishment
    number: 5
    name: "No Punishment, No Shame, No Dead Ends"
    status: locked
    summary: "System never locks users out or judges choices."
    details: |
      Override patterns become learning signals, not defiance.
      Every state has an exit path. The system adapts to user
      behavior without moralizing.
    implications:
      - "No guilt-inducing language"
      - "Overrides tracked as data, not failures"
      - "Every screen has a clear exit"

  - id: constitutional-co-design
    number: 6
    name: "Constitutional Co-Design"
    status: locked
    summary: "Users articulate values that inform system policies."
    details: |
      The system tests values against real scenarios to refine
      understanding. Constitutional rules are user-authored,
      not system-imposed.
    implications:
      - "Onboarding involves value articulation"
      - "Conflicts surfaced for user resolution"
      - "Values can be revised over time"

  - id: orchestrator-as-guardian
    number: 7
    name: "Orchestrator as Guardian Against Manipulation"
    status: locked
    summary: "Final oversight over provider-supplied information."
    details: |
      Validates against constitutional rules. Checks for engagement
      manipulation, dark patterns, misinformation. Constructs
      experiences serving user values, not provider business models.
    implications:
      - "Providers never reach user directly"
      - "Constitutional filtering is mandatory"
      - "Business models subordinate to user values"

  - id: bounded-experiences
    number: 8
    name: "Bounded Experiences, Not Infinite Feeds"
    status: locked
    summary: "Clear entry and exit conditions for every intent."
    details: |
      Completion designed in, not endless scroll. Infinite consumption
      avoided unless user explicitly escalates.
    implications:
      - "Every intent has completion criteria"
      - "No infinite scroll by default"
      - "Escalation requires explicit user choice"
