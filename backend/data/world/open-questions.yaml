# Open Questions
# Unresolved design questions that can be explored through speculative scenarios

questions:
  - id: OQ-1
    name: "Mode Collision Handling"
    status: open
    domain: modes
    question: "What happens when two modes have equal or near-equal confidence?"
    notes: |
      Need to explore through scenarios. Candidate approaches include
      recency bias, user tiebreaker, hierarchical priority, or hybrid modes.

  - id: OQ-2
    name: "Intent Inheritance"
    status: open
    domain: intents
    question: "Can intents span mode transitions, or do they terminate on mode exit?"
    notes: |
      Candidate approaches: hard termination, graceful handoff,
      or intent completion priority with override.

  - id: OQ-3
    name: "Constitutional Conflict"
    status: open
    domain: constitution
    question: "How does the system handle values that contradict in specific scenarios?"
    notes: |
      Example: "don't miss important things" vs "work shouldn't bleed into everything"
      when important work message arrives during family dinner.

  - id: OQ-4
    name: "Urgency Determination"
    status: open
    domain: modes
    question: "What pierces Silence? Who decides what's urgent?"
    notes: |
      Need to define urgency signals and how they interact with
      constitutional values. User-defined vs system-inferred urgency.

  - id: OQ-5
    name: "Learning from Overrides"
    status: open
    domain: constitution
    question: "How much should the system adapt to override patterns?"
    notes: |
      Balance between learning user preferences and maintaining
      constitutional integrity. When is an override a one-time exception
      vs a signal to change behavior?

  - id: OQ-6
    name: "Multi-User Contexts"
    status: open
    domain: modes
    question: "How does LifeOS handle shared spaces and conflicting modes between users?"
    notes: |
      Scenarios: shared devices, co-located users in different modes,
      family contexts, work meetings.

  - id: OQ-7
    name: "Onboarding Flow"
    status: open
    domain: constitution
    question: "How do users initially articulate their constitutional values?"
    notes: |
      Balance between comprehensive value capture and onboarding friction.
      Progressive value discovery vs upfront articulation.

  - id: OQ-8
    name: "Trust Calibration"
    status: open
    domain: architecture
    question: "How does the system earn more autonomy over time? What builds trust?"
    notes: |
      Metrics for trust, progressive autonomy grants,
      trust repair after mistakes.

  - id: OQ-9
    name: "Provider Resistance"
    status: open
    domain: architecture
    question: "How do providers adapt to losing direct access to users?"
    notes: |
      Business model implications, provider incentives,
      potential adversarial dynamics.

  - id: OQ-10
    name: "Edge Cases"
    status: open
    domain: architecture
    question: "What scenarios break the model?"
    notes: |
      Systematically explore edge cases through scenario generation.
      Document model limitations.
