      description: The app-centric model is showing its limitations - users experience fragmentation fatigue
  design_constraint: |
    All LifeOS elements should feel plausible for 2030 - ambitious but not
    fantastical. No magic, no hand-waving. Technology must exist or be
    clearly emerging today.
problem_statement:
  summary: |
    Contemporary digital interaction demands constant cognitive labor: selecting
    appropriate applications, managing context across fragmented tools, and
    navigating rapid transitions between tasks. This produces digital fatigue—not
    from technology use itself, but from the overhead of operating technology.
  diagnosis: |
    The app-centric model treats applications as the primary interface primitive.
    Users must translate goals into app selections, then operate within each app's
    constraints. Context lives in the user's head. Every task switch requires
    cognitive reset.

      description: When user selects intent, system constructs purpose-built interface
  implication: |
    The application layer becomes obsolete when the system can determine context,
    surface relevant intents, and generate interfaces to serve them.
core_tension:
  summary: |
    Mode-intent architecture reduces cognitive load by shifting context management
    and intent curation to the system. But this same shift raises a fundamental
    question: where does user agency sit when the system determines context and
    proposes what you might want?
  statement: |
    This tension between automation benefit and user agency is not incidental to
    the solution—it is the central design problem for human-AI interaction. Every
    design decision in a mode-intent system (how modes are determined, which intents
    surface, how UI is generated) is a negotiation within this tension.
