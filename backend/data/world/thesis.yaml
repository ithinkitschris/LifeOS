problem_statement: >
  Digital interaction today demands constant cognitive labor: selecting appropriate applications,
  managing context across fragmented tools, and navigating rapid transitions between tasks. This
  produces digital fatigue—not from technology use itself, but from the overhead of operating
  technology.
diagnosis: >
  The app-centric model treats applications as the primary interface primitive. Users must translate
  goals into app selections, then operate within each app's constraints. Context lives in the user's
  head. Every task switch requires cognitive reset.
solution:
  name: LifeOS
  summary: >
    An intent-based operating system that:

    - Adapts to context — System determines current mode based on signals (time, location, calendar,
    biometrics, activity)

    - Surfaces relevant intents — Within each mode, presents what user might want to accomplish
    right now

    - Generates UI to serve intents — When user selects intent, system constructs purpose-built
    interface


    The user's job shifts from "choose tool and operate it" to "select intent from
    contextually-relevant options."
core_tension:
  summary: >
    Mode-intent architecture reduces cognitive load by shifting context management and intent
    curation to the system. But this same shift raises a fundamental question: where does user
    agency sit when the system determines context and proposes what you might want?
  statement: >
    This tension between automation benefit and user agency is the central design problem for
    human-AI interaction. Every design decision in a mode-intent system (how modes are determined,
    which intents surface, how UI is generated) is a negotiation within this tension.
scope_and_limitations: >
  Due to the scope of such a problem, this thesis likely won't be able to solve nor pretend to
  propose a solution to this tension. 


  1. The tension is real, persistent, and underexplored — Neither tech-optimist framing (automation
  is unambiguously good) nor tech-critical framing (automation necessarily erodes agency) provides
  useful guidance for practitioners


  2. Mode-intent provides structural vocabulary for engaging with it — Rather than abstract debates
  about "AI and autonomy," designers can examine specific questions: How should mode confidence
  thresholds work? What makes intent surfacing feel helpful vs. manipulative? Where should override
  friction sit?


  3. LifeOS serves as reference architecture, not prescription — A sufficiently specified
  speculative system that enables concrete debate about design decisions, rather than speculation
  from scratch


  The contribution is a platform for informed engagement with this tension—not a claim to have
  solved it.
contributions:
  - id: mode-intent-architecture
    name: Mode-intent as interaction architecture
    description: >
      A structural framework for context-adaptive, intent-driven systems where:

      - Modes define contextual solution space (system-managed)

      - Intents represent user goals within that space (user-selected from surfaced options)

      - Generative UI constructs purpose-built interfaces to serve selected intents


      This architecture proposes that the application layer becomes obsolete when the system can
      determine context, surface relevant intents, and generate interfaces to serve them.

    description: >
      A fully-realized reference system that:

      - Demonstrates mode-intent architecture in concrete detail

      - Makes the automation-agency tension visible and debatable at the level of specific design
      decisions

      - Provides practitioners a platform for exploring human-AI interaction paradigms without
      starting from zero
