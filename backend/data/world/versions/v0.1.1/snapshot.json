      "context": "The app-centric paradigm forces users to maintain context across fragmented tools. AI assistance promises relief but creates new friction: systems that optimize on users' behalf often feel alien. Users report feeling disconnected from decisions made in their name—a loss of agency that undermines the automation benefit.\n",
      "research_question": "What interaction patterns enable AI systems to reduce cognitive overhead while maintaining user agency? Can automation boundaries, override mechanisms, and value alignment be made structural rather than optional?\n",
      "approach": "This thesis explores these questions through LifeOS—a speculative mode-intent architecture where:\n\n1. Context determines available actions (modes)\n2. Users select from system-surfaced options (intents)\n3. Decisions align with articulated values (constitutional frameworks)\n\nThe architecture makes a specific bet: that explicit automation boundaries and structured override paths can preserve agency while delivering convenience. Future self-continuity research suggests this bet may work—when users feel connected to the \"future self\" the system optimizes for, proactive assistance feels helpful rather than imposing.\n",
      "core_tension": "Every design decision negotiates the same tradeoff: present autonomy vs. future benefit. When should the system act as \"future you's advocate\"? How much override friction maintains agency without recreating cognitive overhead? These questions have no universal answers—only context-dependent negotiations.\n",
      "scope_and_limitations": "Due to the scope of such a problem, this thesis likely won't be able to solve nor pretend to propose a solution to this tension. \n\n1. The tension is real, persistent, and underexplored — Neither tech-optimist framing (automation is unambiguously good) nor tech-critical framing (automation necessarily erodes agency) provides useful guidance for practitioners\n\n2. Mode-intent provides structural vocabulary for engaging with it — Rather than abstract debates about \"AI and autonomy,\" designers can examine specific questions: How should mode confidence thresholds work? What makes intent surfacing feel helpful vs. manipulative? Where should override friction sit?\n\n3. LifeOS serves as reference architecture, not prescription — A sufficiently specified speculative system that enables concrete debate about design decisions, rather than speculation from scratch\n\nThe contribution is a platform for informed engagement with this tension—not a claim to have solved it.\n",
