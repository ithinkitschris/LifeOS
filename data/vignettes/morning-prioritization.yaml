tensions_to_surface:
  - id: asking-paradox
    description: "The system has biometric data suggesting poor sleep and elevated stress. Does it tell Chris what it knows, or ask how he feels?"
  - id: priority-autonomy
    description: "The system suggests a priority order for the day based on deadlines and patterns. At what point does suggestion become decision?"
  - id: relationship-presence
    description: "Emma's unread text. The system knows dinner is tonight. How much does it contextualize the relationship vs. just showing the message?"

research_questions:
  - "Where does the morning briefing cross from helpful to presumptuous?"
  - "Does the system's knowledge of your biometrics change how you interpret its suggestions?"
  - "At what point does priority suggestion feel like a decision made for you?"
