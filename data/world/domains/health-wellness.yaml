    content: |
      - Health data is highly personal and sensitive
      - Physiological state affects all other domains
      - Recovery time is productive time
      - Stress response can be detected but requires nuanced interpretation
      - Gamification can be motivating or anxiety-inducing
      - Rest is active wellbeing, not absence of productivity
      - Mental health is as important as physical health
      - Body awareness provides context for all other activities
