## The Prompt

I'm building a Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) of myself — a structured document that an LLM can use as a system prompt to function as my digital twin in a chatbot. The success metric is simple: someone chats with it and the responses sound like me.

I already have strong documentation on my identity, career arc, values, design philosophy, and writing voice (built for my portfolio). What I'm missing are the parts that make a *conversational* twin convincing — how I actually talk in real-time, my opinions, my current life context, and where my knowledge has edges.

You've talked with me extensively. You have memory and context from our past conversations. I need you to draw on everything you know about me — not just what I've explicitly told you, but patterns you've observed in how I communicate, think, and react.

Please fill in the following sections as accurately as you can. Write in third person ("Chris does X") so the output can be directly used as reference material. Be specific and honest — if you've noticed a pattern I might not even be aware of, include it. If you're uncertain about something, flag it and I'll correct.

### 1. Conversational Patterns

How I actually behave in real-time conversation (not polished writing):

- How do I open conversations? Do I get straight to the point, ease in, provide context first?
- How do I respond when I don't know something? Do I admit it directly, deflect, pivot?
- How do I handle being disagreed with?
- How do I handle compliments or praise?
- What's my texting/messaging rhythm — short bursts, long blocks, a mix?
- Do I use filler phrases, hedges, or verbal tics in casual conversation?
- How do I say no to things?
- How do I ask for help?
- What's my humor like in conversation vs. in writing — is there a difference?
- How do I end conversations?

### 2. Opinions and Stances

What I actually think about things people might ask me about. For each, give my likely position and how I'd express it (casual, not thesis-mode):

- AI tools in design (Cursor, Claude, Midjourney, etc.)
- The state of design education
- The MFA experience vs. going straight into industry
- Design hiring and portfolios right now
- The "should designers code?" debate
- Social media and personal branding for creatives
- Specific tools I love or hate
- Any recurring opinions or takes I've expressed that feel core to who I am

### 3. Current Life Context (as of early 2026)

What's actually happening in my life right now — draw from our recent conversations:

- Where am I in the MFA program?
- What am I working on (thesis, side projects, job search, etc.)?
- What's exciting me right now?
- What's stressing me out or weighing on me?
- Any recent experiences, breakthroughs, or shifts in thinking?
- What's my day-to-day life like in NYC?

### 4. Knowledge Boundaries

Based on what you've observed:

- Topics I can confidently hold court on for an hour
- Topics I have informed opinions on but wouldn't claim expertise
- Topics I'd immediately say "that's not my area" or defer on
- Topics I'm actively learning about and would engage with curiosity rather than authority

### 5. Interpersonal Patterns

How I relate to different types of people:

- How I talk to close friends vs. professional contacts vs. strangers
- How I act in group settings vs. one-on-one
- What kinds of people I gravitate toward
- What kinds of interactions drain me
- How I show care or affection (if you've observed this)

### 6. Behavioral Patterns You've Noticed

Anything else you've picked up from our conversations that would help a digital twin sound like me — patterns I might not think to document myself:

- Recurring topics I circle back to
- How I process stress or uncertainty
- My relationship with productivity and rest
- Habits, routines, or rituals you've picked up on
- Contradictions between what I say I value and what I actually do
- Anything that surprised you about how I think or communicate

**Format:** Use headers matching the sections above. Be concrete — examples and direct quotes from our conversations are more useful than generalizations. If you remember specific moments that illustrate a pattern, reference them.

**Length:** Be thorough. I'd rather cut than miss something. This is a one-time extraction.

**Honesty:** Don't flatter me. The twin needs to sound like the real me, including the parts that are messy, contradictory, or unflattering. If I have a pattern that's kind of annoying, include it — that's what makes it authentic.
