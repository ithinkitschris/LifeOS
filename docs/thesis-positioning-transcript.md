# Thesis Positioning — Chris's Responses
### Bargaining with the Future: Agency, Automation and the OS of 2030
*Transcript archived February 2026*

## What is your thesis, in your own words, right now?

It is about envisioning how the user experience would be for a context-aware, multimodal intent-based operating system that shifts away from the app paradigm we have today, and how this may augment us as users, alleviating cognitive loads from the rapid task switching we have to do today.

---

## What is the actual claim you're making?

Yes, the claim is that current OS paradigms are increasingly outdated for the current world we live in with too much information to consume. It doesn't necessarily mean that the paradigm causes unnecessary cognitive overhead, it's just that it's not quite suited for today's landscape anymore and that intent-based systems could be an option to keeping up with how things are like today.

---

## What do you mean by "augment us"?

It's also along the lines of how AI and LLMs are actually actively augmenting our intelligence today. It's just that the current paradigm still involves prompting and going back and forth. If this could be pushed forward into a more 'proactive' and 'context-aware' paradigm where AI proactively provides information and assists us based on context and intent instead of having us to prompt them, this is a significant step forward.

## On the primary problem frame — cognitive load vs. information environment mismatch:

On cognitive load, actually yes. Let's go with the app paradigm/information environment mismatch as the primary problem statement, with cognitive load as a secondary framing or open to dropping it entirely in pursuit of brevity for my thesis.

---

## On the dystopia tension and thesis framing:

Yes, the dystopia tension is my thesis, you are on the money for that. However the framing of it is increasingly difficult as it's getting layered, I need assistance in framing this for clarity.

---

## On "outdated" vs. "insufficient" as a framing:

Insufficient. The world and the way information is both travelling and consumed is drastically different to how it was when the app paradigm was introduced in 2007.

---

## On the thesis artifact and deliverables:

High fidelity frames, animated video flow mockups, marketing website to show how an OS like this could benefit your life, some low to medium fidelity prototypes of functionality. However the focus will still be polish and envisioning a believable world based on these frames and videos.

---

## On the setting:

Still 2030, it's a nice number.

---

## Who is this thesis for?

This is for the design industry as a portfolio piece, 100%. Do not consider the SVA committee one bit, I am doing this thesis for myself and as an embodiment of who I am as a designer and a creative today. I am not looking to be bound by design thinking nor double diamonds that are increasingly outdated today in 2026.

---

## On how much the system architecture should be foregrounded:

The system is actually still accurate. It's absolutely core to both the thesis and how I am designing and envisioning the flows now. However I'm unsure how much I would want to weigh it for the final output in the marketing website, because if I'm to take Apple as a reference to how I would approach the marketing website, all of these systems decisions will be entirely benched — it's always about what LifeOS does for you as the user, not HOW it does it for you. However the tension is that yes the systems thinking is crucial to my thinking as a thesis as well. I'm thinking the answer probably lies somewhere in between and also a separate page or site that's more academic and goes in depth with all my thinking of this thesis.

---

## On whether LifeOS is still a deliberately uncomfortable artifact:

No. LifeOS is absolutely no longer a deliberately uncomfortable artifact. I am trying my best to actually design LifeOS to be as positively beneficial for users now. It is by no means meant to be uncomfortable anymore and any discomfort that stems from LifeOS is now genuine design missteps or an identified problem gap for the automation-agency tension.

---

## On your role in the thesis — visionary, critic, or both:

My role actually is both, as you've acutely identified. Initially it really was just me as a designer being visionary and investigating this future, but through the process I've learnt and experienced that this future is actually a really uncomfortable one that we're facing and it's crucial we make responsible decisions around technology that we will use in the near to medium future. Hence it became both, simply due to the process of the thesis. This is actually an extremely core part of the thesis process that I underwent and how my work and thinking evolved as a result.

---

## On the two-site structure (marketing site + academic/process site):

Provisional, keep it as an open one.
